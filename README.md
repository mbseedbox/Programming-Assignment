#### **Project Plan Template**

| **Project Title** | **Client Management System** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Date** | 2025-08-07 |
| **Project Manager** | [Student Name] |
| **Project Goal/s** | To develop a simple, command-line based application to allow a small business owner to manage client contact information efficiently and securely. The system will provide core functions for adding, viewing, searching, and deleting client records. |
| **Project Scope** | **In-Scope Activities:**<br><ul><li>Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.</li><li>Functionality to add a new client record (Name, Company, Email, Phone).</li><li>Functionality to view a list of all saved client records.</li><li>Functionality to search for a specific client by name.</li><li>Functionality to delete a client record.</li><li>Persistent data storage using a local CSV file for simplicity and portability.</li><li>Adherence to Python coding standards, including comments and modular design.</li></ul><br>**Out-of-Scope Activities:**<br><ul><li>A graphical user interface (GUI).</li><li>User authentication, login systems, or access controls.</li><li>Network-based or cloud database storage.</li><li>Advanced reporting or data analytics features.</li><li>Multi-user capability.</li></ul> |
| **Project Timeline** | **Phase 1: Planning & Design (Week 1)**<br><ul><li>Define project requirements and scope.</li><li>Create Project Plan and User Stories.</li><li>Design application structure and data format.</li></ul><br>**Phase 2: Core Development (Week 2)**<br><ul><li>Implement core application loop.</li><li>Develop functions for adding clients and viewing all clients.</li><li>Implement data persistence (saving to/loading from CSV).</li></ul><br>**Phase 3: Feature Enhancement & Testing (Week 3)**<br><ul><li>Develop functions for searching and deleting clients.</li><li>Write unit tests for each function.</li><li>Begin documenting the code.</li></ul><br>**Phase 4: Finalization & Review (Week 4)**<br><ul><li>Complete all code commenting and finalize documentation.</li><li>Perform final user acceptance testing (UAT).</li><li>Prepare the project for submission.</li></ul> |
| **Budget** | Not applicable (internal student project). |
| **Team Roles and Responsibilities** | <ul><li>**Project Manager:** [Student Name] - Responsible for overall project oversight, ensuring milestones are met, and managing documentation.</li><li>**Lead Developer:** [Student Name] - Responsible for writing, structuring, and managing the Python application code.</li><li>**QA Tester:** [Student Name] - Responsible for creating and executing test plans, identifying bugs, and verifying that the application meets all specified requirements.</li></ul> |
| **Communication Plan** | <ul><li>**Team Meetings:** A weekly virtual stand-up meeting will be held via Google Meet to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.</li><li>**Primary Communication Channel:** A dedicated Slack channel will be used for all day-to-day communication, quick questions, and status updates.</li><li>**Code Management:** A private GitHub repository will be used for version control and issue tracking.</li><li>**Reporting:** A brief weekly progress report will be compiled by the Project Manager.</li></ul> |
| **Success Criteria** | <ul><li>The final application successfully performs all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as defined in the scope.</li><li>The project is completed within the defined 4-week timeline.</li><li>The final Python code is well-commented, follows PEP 8 standards, and is stored in the GitHub repository.</li><li>All required documentation (Project Plan, User Stories, Testing Documentation) is completed to a high standard.</li></ul> |
