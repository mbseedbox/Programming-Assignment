### **1.3 Data Structures**

Data structures are used to store and organize data. In `client_manager.py`, the primary data structures are **lists** and **dictionaries**. They work together to create a simple, in-memory database of client information that is read from and written to a CSV file.

**1. Dictionaries**

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. In this application, **each individual client is represented as a dictionary**.

*   **Structure:** The keys of the dictionary (`'name'`, `'company'`, `'email'`, `'phone'`) correspond to the headers in the CSV file (defined in the `FIELDNAMES` constant). The values are the specific details for that client.

*   **Example:** A dictionary for a single client would look like this:
    ```python
    {
        'name': 'Alice',
        'company': 'Innovate Inc',
        'email': 'alice@innovate.com',
        'phone': '123-456-7890'
    }
    ```

*   **Usage:**
    *   In the `add_client` function, a new dictionary `new_client` is created to hold the data entered by the user before it's written to the file.
    *   When reading from the CSV using `csv.DictReader`, each row is automatically converted into a dictionary.

**2. Lists**

A list is an ordered collection of items. In this application, a **list is used to hold all the client dictionaries**.

*   **Structure:** The entire collection of clients is stored in a list, where each item in the list is a client dictionary.

*   **Example:** A list containing two clients would look like this:
    ```python
    [
        {
            'name': 'Alice',
            'company': 'Innovate Inc',
            'email': 'alice@innovate.com',
            'phone': '123-456-7890'
        },
        {
            'name': 'Bob',
            'company': 'Buildit Co',
            'email': 'bob@buildit.co',
            'phone': '098-765-4321'
        }
    ]
    ```

*   **Usage:**
    *   The `load_clients` function returns this list of dictionaries.
    *   The `view_clients` and `search_client` functions iterate over this list to display the data.
    *   The `delete_client` function uses a list comprehension to create a *new* list that excludes the client to be deleted. This new list then overwrites the old data file.
    *   The `save_clients` function takes this list of dictionaries and writes it to the `clients.csv` file using `csv.DictWriter.writerows()`.

**How They Work Together**

The combination of lists and dictionaries is powerful. The list provides an ordered container for all the client records, while each dictionary within the list provides a structured way to store the details for a single client. This "list of dictionaries" format is a very common and effective way to manage structured data in Python, and it maps perfectly to the row-and-column structure of a CSV file.
