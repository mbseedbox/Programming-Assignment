### **2.3 Data Flow Diagram**

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) helps visualize how data moves through a system. For `client_manager.py`, the flow is centered around the user, the main application logic, and the `clients.csv` file.

**Explanation of the Data Flow**

1.  **User Interaction:** The user is the starting point for all data flows. They interact with the system by providing input (menu choices, client details).

2.  **Main Program (`client_manager.py`):** This is the central process that controls the application.
    *   It **receives** the user's menu choice.
    *   Based on the choice, it calls the appropriate function (e.g., `add_client`, `view_clients`).

3.  **Flow for Adding a Client (1):**
    *   The user selects "Add Client".
    *   The program prompts the user for **Client Details** (name, company, etc.).
    *   The user provides these details.
    *   The `add_client` function takes these details, formats them into a new client record (a dictionary), and **appends** this record directly to the `clients.csv` file.

4.  **Flow for Viewing/Searching Clients (2 & 3):**
    *   The user selects "View Clients" or "Search Clients".
    *   The `load_clients` function is called, which **reads all Client Records** from the `clients.csv` file.
    *   These records are loaded into the program as a list of dictionaries (the **Client List**).
    *   *For a search*, the user provides a **Search Term**, which the program uses to filter the Client List.
    *   The program then formats this list (or the filtered list) and **displays** it to the user as a formatted table.

5.  **Flow for Deleting a Client (4):**
    *   The user selects "Delete Client" and provides the **Name to Delete**.
    *   The program first **loads all Client Records** from `clients.csv` (using `load_clients`).
    *   It finds the matching client and asks the user for **Confirmation ('y/n')**.
    *   If confirmed, the program creates a new, updated list in memory that excludes the deleted client.
    *   The `save_clients` function is then called to **overwrite** the entire `clients.csv` file with this **Updated Client List**.

**External Entity:**

*   **User:** The person interacting with the CLI.

**Processes:**

*   **Main Program (`client_manager.py`):** The core application logic that routes commands.
*   **Functions** like `add_client`, `view_clients`, etc., which handle specific tasks.

**Data Stores:**

*   **`clients.csv`:** The persistent data store (the file on disk).

**Data Flows:**

*   Arrows indicate the direction in which data moves (e.g., from the user to the program, or from the program to the file).
