### **1.2 Control Structures**

Control structures are fundamental to any program, as they direct the flow of execution. The `client_manager.py` script uses several types of control structures effectively.

**1. Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)**

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in the code. The primary example is in the `main` function, where the program decides which function to call based on the user's input.

*   **How it works:** The code checks the value of the `choice` variable. If it matches `'1'`, `add_client()` is called. If not, it checks the next condition (`elif choice == '2'`), and so on. If none of the conditions for '1' through '5' are met, the final `else` block is executed, informing the user of an invalid choice.

    ```python
    if choice == '1':
        add_client()
    elif choice == '2':
        view_clients()
    elif choice == '3':
        search_client()
    elif choice == '4':
        delete_client()
    elif choice == '5':
        print("Exiting program. Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
    ```

*   **Other Examples:**
    *   In `add_client()`, an `if` statement is used for validation to check if the client's name is empty.
        ```python
        if not name:
            print("Client name cannot be empty. Aborting.")
            return
        ```
    *   In `delete_client()`, an `if/else` statement is used to handle the user's confirmation (`y/n`) before deleting a record.

**2. Looping Structures (`while`, `for`)**

Loops are used to repeat a block of code.

*   **`while` Loop:** The main application loop in the `main` function uses `while True:`. This creates an infinite loop that keeps the program running and the menu displaying until the user explicitly chooses to exit. The `break` statement is the control structure used to exit this loop when the user's choice is `'5'`.

    ```python
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ").strip()
        # ... (if/elif/else block) ...
        if choice == '5':
            # ...
            break # This exits the while loop
    ```

*   **`for` Loop:** `for` loops are used to iterate over sequences, such as lists.
    *   In `view_clients()`, a `for` loop iterates through the `clients` list to print each client's details.
        ```python
        for client in clients:
            print(f"{client['name']:<20} | {client['company']:<20} | ...")
        ```
    *   In `delete_client()`, a `for` loop is used to search through the list of clients to find the one to delete. The `break` statement is used here to stop the loop as soon as a match is found, making the code more efficient.
        ```python
        for client in clients:
            if client['name'].lower() == delete_name:
                client_to_delete = client
                break # Stop searching once found
        ```

These control structures are the building blocks that allow the program to be interactive, respond to user input, and process data in a structured way.
