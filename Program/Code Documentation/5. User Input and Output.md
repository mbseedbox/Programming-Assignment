### **2.2 User Input and Output**

Effective user input and output (I/O) are essential for a command-line interface (CLI) application. They form the bridge between the user and the program's logic. In `client_manager.py`, I/O is handled through clear, consistent prompts and formatted displays.

**1. Displaying Information (Output)**

The application uses the `print()` function for all output, but it employs several techniques to make the output user-friendly and readable.

*   **Main Menu (`display_menu` function):**
    *   This function prints a static block of text that clearly lists the available options (1-5). The use of a "box" made of `=` characters visually separates the menu from other program output, making it easy for the user to see their options at a glance.

    5. Exit
    ====================================
    ```

*   **Formatted Tables (`view_clients` and `search_client`):**
    *   To display lists of clients in a structured way, the application prints a formatted table. This is achieved using **f-strings** with specified column widths.
    *   `print(f"{'Name':<20} | {'Company':<20} | ...")`: The `<` character left-aligns the text, and the number (`20`, `30`, `15`) reserves a fixed number of characters for that column. This ensures that all rows line up neatly, regardless of the length of the data in each field.
    *   `print("-" * 88)`: A separator line is printed by multiplying the "-" character. This creates a visual divider between the header and the data rows, further improving readability.

*   **User Prompts and Feedback:**
    *   The program provides clear feedback for every action. For example, after adding a client, it prints "Client added successfully!". If a search finds no results, it prints "No client found...". This confirms to the user that their action was processed and tells them the outcome.

**2. Gathering Information (Input)**

The application uses the `input()` function to gather all information from the user.

*   **Menu Choice:**
    *   `choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ").strip()`: The program prompts the user to enter a number. The `.strip()` method is called on the result. This is a crucial data sanitization step that removes any accidental leading or trailing whitespace (e.g., if the user accidentally hits the spacebar before typing).

*   **Client Details (`add_client`, `search_client`, `delete_client`):**
    *   Similar to the menu choice, `.strip()` is used on all user-provided data (name, company, etc.) to ensure the stored data is clean.
    *   `name = input("Enter client name: ").strip()`

*   **Confirmation (`delete_client`):**
    *   A confirmation step is included before performing a destructive action like deletion. This is a critical usability feature that prevents accidental data loss.
    *   `confirm = input("Are you sure you want to delete this client? (y/n): ").strip().lower()`: Here, two methods are chained: `.strip()` to clean whitespace, and `.lower()` to convert the input to lowercase. This allows the user to type 'Y' or 'y' and have both be accepted as a positive confirmation, making the program more robust.
