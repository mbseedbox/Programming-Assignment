# Reviewed by Krispe, 10/09/2025 â€“ Checked logic for client creation and tested main input flow.
# Looks good! Left a couple of suggestions below, especially on error handling for edge cases.

# Suggestion (Krispe): Could add input validation in 'add_client' so email has an '@' and phone is numbers only.
